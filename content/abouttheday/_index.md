# The reception
The wedding reception will be held at Karel 1, the museum cafe of the Van AbbeMuseum of Modern and Contemporary Art in Eindhoven. 

Guests are invited to arrive at or around 17.00. If you want to visit the museum, make sure to arrive earlier as it closes at 17.00.

Here's a general idea of the evening:

 | | | 
--- | --- | --- 
17.00 | reception begins | drinks, snacks
17.30 | Andrea & James arrive | bubbly!
18.00 - 21.00 | buffet dinner served | toasts, speeches, &c.
21.00 - late | dancing, &c. | late night snacks


Please join us at 17.00 on Friday, 22 June 2018 for dinner, toasts, and dancing. 

If you have not yet completed the [RSVP form](/rsvp), please do so. We'll be in touch with questions about dietary restrictions in the next few weeks. 



# What should I wear?
The Netherlands gets lots of rain all year round; June is no exception. We’d advise bringing a rain jacket or umbrella for getting to and from the museum, but the reception will be indoors. We'll be quite dressed up, and you're welcome to do the same, but wear clothes and shoes you are comfortable in and can dance in. All guests are welcome to and wear white, black, or any color in between!


# How do I get to Karel 1? 
Karel 1 and the Van AbbeMuseum are in the center of Eindhoven at Stratumsedijk 2. From the train station, it’s a 20 minute walk. Several busses depart from the train station. 

If you're coming from the ceremony in Nijmegen, you can travel with us in the bus we've chartered. The bus will leave from Nijmegen at 15.00 and will arrive in Eindhoven at the Central Station around 16.00. You'll have about an hour to go to your hotel, visit the museum, or walk around Eindhoven before the reception starts at 17.00.
