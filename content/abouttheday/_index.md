# What should I wear?
The Netherlands gets lots of rain all year round; June is no exception. We’d advise bringing a rain jacket or umbrella for getting to and from the museum, but the reception will be indoors. We'll be quite dressed up, and you're welcome to do the same, but wear clothes and shoes you are comfortable in and can dance in. All guests are welcome to and wear white, black, or any color in between!


# How do I get to Karel 1? 
Karel 1 and the Van AbbeMuseum are in the center of Eindhoven at Stratumsedijk 2. From the train station (Eindhoven Centraal Station), it’s a 20 minute walk. Several busses depart from the train station.
