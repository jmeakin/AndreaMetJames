Andrea and James both moved to the Netherlands in 2013; Andrea, from the US, to begin a PhD in the city of Nijmegen, and James, just having finished his in England, to take a job with Philips in the city of Eindhoven. A few months after their respective arrivals, they met at an Alasdair Roberts gig. They’ve been together ever since. 

Andrea and James have lived together in Nijmegen since 2016. In June 2018, Andrea and James will be married in the historic Nijmegen stadhuis. They’ll celebrate their wedding in Eindhoven and then in Portland, Maine (USA).
