Eindhoven, in the southern region of the Netherlands, is the fifth-largest Dutch city. It has a [small airport](https://www.eindhovenairport.nl/en) served by airlines like Ryanair and Transavia and is 1.5 hours by train from Schiphol airport in Amsterdam. 

Eindhoven is not a conventionally thought of as a romantic place. It’s one of the more industrial Dutch cities, with a history of manufacturing (matches and then lightbulbs- Philips was founded here in 1891), and now cultivates itself as a center for design and technology. It hosts Dutch Design Week every year and is the home to several technical schools and design institutes.

But it’s the place where we first really got to know each other. When we first started dating, we spent the work weeks apart, but Andrea would always join James for the weekend in Eindhoven. And we were thrilled to find that we could have our wedding reception at the VanAbbe and Karel 1.
